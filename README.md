# Zara Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Performed an in-depth analysis of Zara’s sales dataset using Python and Pandas to uncover revenue trends, material performance, and distribution patterns across key product categories.

## Key Highlights
- Analyzed **6,000+ transactions** to identify top-selling materials and performance trends.  
- Computed summary statistics including mean, median, and standard deviation for each product category.  
- Created visualizations for **sales distribution**, **material performance**, and **category-wise sales** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Derived insights to support inventory and pricing optimization strategies.
- Built a Random Forest model to predict sales performance and validate material-wise insights.


## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Dataset
This dataset, called Zara Sales for EDA, was created by combining several public fashion datasets from GitHub and Kaggle.
It focuses on Zara products and includes information such as product name, description, price, category, and sales volume.
Additional columns like season and url were added for instance, season was assigned based on product names (e.g., “jacket” → Winter/Autumn), 
and url was generated by combining Zara’s base link with the product title.
The original dataset had around 7K rows, so oversampling was applied to increase the number of records and balance categories for better analysis.  


## Results
- **Top 3 Materials:** Linen Blend, Acrylic, and Wool Blend.  
- **Highest Average Sales:** Linen Blend (~1125 per unit).  
- **Lowest Variation:** Viscose category, indicating stable performance.
